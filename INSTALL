1) Built on Linux with Python 2.7.  Requires that mysqld/mariadb and the
   rtl-sdr tools be installed.  Requires the Python development package
   (e.g. python-devel.  Tested on Linux.

2) Install and configure mysql and mysqld (do this first), and the devel
   headers/libraries (e.g. mariadb-devel).  You need max_allowed_packet
   (in my.cnf) to be large enough to handle CHUNK_SIZE in rtl_fm.

3) Install Python setuptools and run ./setup.py install

4) Edit fwsetup.sql to match your password and database preferences

5) From the freqwatch directory: $ cat fwsetup.sql | mysql -u root -p

6) Edit freqwatch.conf to reflect the database settings (and password),
   as well as your rtl-sdr stick configurations

7) Change permissions on freqwatch.conf so your db password isn't visible to
   others.

8) Install the libusb development package and make any necessary symbolic
   links for the header files

9) Change to the rtl_fm_new directory and run 'make'

10) To use monitors based on the modified rtl_fm, install gpsd and gpsd-devel,
    change to the rtl_fm_new directory and run 'make'.  You can change the
    CHUNK_SIZE define in the modified source to suit your needs.  You may have
    to adjust your sql server configuration and increase max_allowed_packet if
    you run into issues.
